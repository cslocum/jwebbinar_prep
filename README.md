# JWebbinar material

## Branch frozen for Webbinar 10

This Branch is a frozen version for JWebbinar "Simulations with MIRAGE and MIRISim". If you want a version of the materials that is being maintained, see the `main` branch of this repository.

To download the material, you can clone this repository and navigate to this folder:  
`git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwebbinar_prep.git ~/my_jwebbinar_prep`  
`cd ~/my_jwebbinar_prep`  
`git checkout webbinar10`  
`cd simulators_session`  

Alternatively, you can manually download the individual notebooks by clicking on the simulators_session folder, then click on each file, and right-click on "Raw" to select "Save link as".

To run these notebooks locally, you will need a Python environment set up that is capable of running Jupyter notebooks. If you are new to Python, you may want to look here: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/ for some resources on how to install and learn the basics of Python. Depending on your preferences and system choices, you may find the install instructions there sufficient, but note that many scientists find it easier to use the Anaconda python distribution and package manager: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

This webinar showcased two packages: MIRAGE and MIRISim. They have their own specific installation setups, thus we encourage the user to check out their respective webpages for instructions.
MIRAGE - https://mirage-data-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
MIRISim - https://wiki.miricle.org/Public/MIRISim_Public#Installation_Instructions
